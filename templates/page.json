We started researching products and discovered that most had chemicals formulated for aesthetic effects rather than efficacy. Some of these chemicals have been shown to have cancer causing potential and other deleterious side effects. As physicians we realize how important it is to read labels and understand everything that we put on and into our bodies to prevent long term complications and diseases.<\/p>"

Sodium lauryl sulfate and other similar surfactants are known skin irritants but continue to be used heavily in shampoos due to their ability to create more aesthetic sudsing. Other preservatives such as methylisothializones have been implicated as being toxic to the nervous system. Hydroquinone has been implicated as a possible carcinogen and is being currently investigated by the FDA. Cancer rates are on the rise and we do not know why. Environment and genetics are both factors. However it is imperative on us to limit the dependency on possibly toxic ingredients that we use daily. ORIGENERE® has eliminated any potentially harmful ingredients from all our products<\/p>"
