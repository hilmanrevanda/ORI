In some individuals, the enzyme converts testosterone into DHT, which binds to receptors in the hair follicles. <\/p><p><strong>Sensitivity of Hair Follicles:<\/strong> Hair follicles on the scalp contain androgen receptors, including receptors for DHT. In individuals with a genetic predisposition, these hair follicles may be more sensitive to the effects of DHT.<\/p><p><strong>Miniaturization of Hair Follicles:<\/strong> When DHT binds to the androgen receptors in the hair follicles, it can lead to a process called miniaturization. Miniaturization refers to the gradual shrinking and weakening of the affected hair follicles over time.<\/p><p><strong>Shortened Hair Growth Cycle: <\/strong>DHT can shorten the duration of the hair growth cycle, leading to a reduction in the growth phase of the hair follicles. This results in shorter and thinner hair strands, making the hair appear less dense and eventually leading to hair thinning or hair loss.<\/p><p><strong>Progressive Hair Loss: <\/strong>As the hair follicles continue to be exposed to DHT, they become progressively smaller and weaker with each hair growth cycle. This can eventually lead to the production of vellus hairs, which are short, fine, and barely visible hairs, or even the complete cessation of hair growth from affected follicles. <\/p><p>It's important to note that not everyone with a genetic predisposition to DHT will experience hair loss.
